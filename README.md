Simple Webapp to enjoy sport tournaments with family and friends!
Made using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express.js and React.js and Tailwind CSS
I also plan to automate some stuff by scaping the web. 
Currently it only runs locally:
-  npm run devstart the server first on localhost:3000 and then npm start the client on localhost:3001
And then enjoy predicting tournament results :D
