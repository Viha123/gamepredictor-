Simple Webapp to enjoy sport tournaments with family and friends! 

Made using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express.js and React.js and Tailwind CSS

Currently it only runs locally:
-  npm run devstart the server first on localhost:3000 and then npm start the client on localhost:3001

The tournament that this scrapes from is already over, however this year there will be 2 other major cricketing tournaments that I wish to add features of when they are relevant.
